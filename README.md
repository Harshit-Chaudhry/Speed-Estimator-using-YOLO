# 🚗 Speed Estimation Project using YOLO Models  

## 📌 Description  

This project involves the development of a **speed estimation system** using **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** object detection models. The system is designed to **detect vehicles in real-time** and estimate their speed based on successive video frames.  

The primary goal is to create an **efficient and accurate speed estimation tool** for **traffic monitoring and analysis**.  

## 🔥 Features  

✅ **Real-time vehicle detection** using YOLO models  
✅ **Speed estimation** based on frame-by-frame analysis  
✅ Works with **live webcam feeds** and **video files**  
✅ **Visualization** of detected vehicles and their estimated speeds  
✅ Supports **custom YOLO models** for better accuracy

## 📝 How It Works  

### **1️⃣ Object Detection with YOLO**  
The system uses **YOLOv8** to detect vehicles in **real-time** from a video stream (webcam or file).  

### **2️⃣ Speed Calculation**  
The speed is estimated by tracking the **change in position** of detected vehicles over **successive frames** and applying a **conversion factor (pixels to real-world units).**  

### **3️⃣ Visualization**  
Detected vehicles are **highlighted with bounding boxes**, and their **estimated speeds** are displayed on the video.

## 📌 Code Files Explanation  

- **`main.py`** → Runs **real-time vehicle detection** using a **live webcam feed**.  
- **`vid_main.py`** → Processes **pre-recorded video files** to **detect vehicles** and **estimate speed**.  
- **`trials.ipynb`** → Jupyter Notebook for **testing and debugging** detection logic.

## 💡 Notes  

- The **YOLO model can be trained** on a **custom dataset** to improve accuracy.  
- If you encounter **errors** in webcam mode, check that your camera is properly connected.  
- You can **replace `output_video.mp4` and `download.mp4`** with your **own demo files**.

## 🚀 Future Improvements  

- 📈 **Improve accuracy** with custom YOLO training  
- 🛣️ **Support multi-lane detection** for highways  
- 📊 **Store speed data** for analytics and reporting
