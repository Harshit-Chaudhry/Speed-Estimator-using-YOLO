# Speed Estimation Project using YOLO Models

## Description

This project involves the development of a speed estimation system using YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection models. The system is designed to detect vehicles in real-time and estimate their speed based on successive video frames. The primary goal is to create an efficient and accurate speed estimation tool for traffic monitoring and analysis.

## Features

- Real-time vehicle detection using YOLO models
- Speed estimation based on successive frames
- Integration with video streaming sources
- Visualization of detected vehicles and their estimated speeds

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- YOLOv3 or YOLOv4 pre-trained weights
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository :-'
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speed-estimation-yolo.git
   cd speed-estimation-yolo

2. Create Virtual Environments :-
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   
3. Install Requirements :-
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
4. Run Main.py file :-
   ```bash
   python main.py
